# Project Factory

The project factory will:
- create a service account with defined rights
- create a project within the folder
- connect the service account to the Github repository informantion

It uses YAML configuration files for every project with the following sample structure:
```
billing_account_id: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX
roles:
    - roles/viewer
    - roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
    - roles/iam.securityReviewer
    - roles/monitoring.viewer
    - roles/monitoring.editor
    - roles/monitoring.alertPolicyViewer
    - roles/monitoring.alertPolicyEditor
    - roles/monitoring.dashboardViewer
    - roles/monitoring.dashboardEditor
    - roles/monitoring.notificationChannelViewer
    - roles/monitoring.notificationChannelEditor
    - roles/monitoring.servicesViewer

    - roles/storage.objectCreator
    - roles/storage.objectViewer
repo_provider: github
