With VPC Service Controls, you can define policies that restrict the traffic that can flow between your Google Cloud resources and other Google services, including third-party services.

Let's say you have a Google Cloud project that contains sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data. You want to make sure that this data is protected from unauthorized access or exfiltration, to achieve this, you can use VPC Service Controls to create a security perimeter around your project  like you can create a policy that allows your project to access specific Google services, such as Google Cloud Storage or Google Cloud SQL, but blocks access to other services that are not necessary for your project. You can also create a policy that requires all traffic to or from your project to be encrypted or authenticated using specific protocols or methods.
